<h1>Biography</h1>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-6 col-12 d-block m-auto">
<blockquote>Undoubtedly, Hazrat Baba Bulleh Shah is the “King of Sufi poetry”. A humanist, Sufi poet, philosopher, teacher, rebel, and internationalist, Baba Bulleh Shah was truly a legend.
</blockquote>
<h4>Early life and background</h4>
<blockquote>Bulleh Shah was born in 1680, in the small village of Uch, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. His ancestors had migrated from Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan.
 He relocated to Malakwal with his parents at a very early age. Bulleh Shah received his early education from Pandoke and
 later moved to Kasur for higher education. Maulana Mohiyuddin was his teacher. Eminent Sufi saint, Shah Inayat Qadiri was
 his spiritual teacher and he played a vital role in developing his love for Sufism. Hazrat Baba Bulleh Shah and his 
family descend directly from the Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H.).
</blockquote>
<p>
بلھے شاہ 1680 میں ، بہاولپور ، پاکستان کے اوچ گاوں میں پیدا ہوئے۔ اس کے آباؤ اجداد جدید ازبکستان میں بخارا سے ہجرت کرچکے ہیں۔ وہ بہت کم عمری میں ہی اپنے والدین کے ساتھ ملاکوال منتقل ہوگیا۔ بلھے شاہ 
نے ابتدائی تعلیم پانڈوکی سے حاصل کی اور بعد میں اعلی تعلیم کے لئے قصور چلا گیا۔ مولانا محی الدین اس کے استاد تھے۔ ممتاز صوفی بزرگ ، شاہ عنایت قادری ان کے روحانی استاد تھے 
اور انہوں نے تصوف سے اپنی محبت کو فروغ دینے میں اہم کردار ادا کیا۔ حضرت بابا بلھے شاہ اور ان کے اہل خانہ سیدھے سیدنا حضرت محمد صلی اللہ علیہ وآلہ وسلم سے اترتے ہیں۔
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>Baba Bulleh Shah established a direct relationship with God. He recognised no role of mediators in this respect, except the guidance of his spiritual master Baba Anayat Shah Qadri.
<br>
Inayat Shah lived in Lahore, so he was called Inayat Shah Lahori. He belonged to the Arain caste and earned his living through agriculture or gardening. He also lived in Qasur for some time, but due to the animosity of the ruler of Qasur he shifted to Lahore, where he remained till the end of his life. His tomb is also situated near Lahore. Whatever questions or doubts Bulleh Shah had in his mind before he met his Master, were all drowned in the experience of inner light.  When he had made up his mind to come to Inayat Shah, people had dissuaded him from doing so, saying, "You are a great scholar, a master of miraculous powers and a descendent of prophet Mohammed.  
</blockquote>
<p>
بابا بلھے شاہ نے خدا کے ساتھ براہ راست تعلق قائم کیا۔ انہوں نے اس سلسلے میں ثالثوں کے کسی کردار کو نہیں پہچانا 
، سوائے اس کے روحانی آقا بابا عنایت شاہ قادری کی رہنمائی کے۔ عنایت شاہ لاہور میں رہتے تھے ، لہذا انہیں عنایت شاہ لاہوری کہا جاتا تھا۔ اس کا تعلق اورین ذات سے تھا 
اور زراعت یا باغبانی کے ذریعہ اپنی روزی کمایا تھا۔ وہ کچھ عرصہ قصور میں بھی مقیم رہا ، لیکن قصور کے حکمران کی عداوت کے سبب وہ لاہور شفٹ ہوگی
 ، جہاں وہ اپنی زندگی کے آخری وقت تک رہا۔ اس کا مقبرہ بھی لاہور کے قریب واقع ہے۔ 
اپنے مالک سے ملنے سے پہلے بلھے شاہ کے ذہن میں جو بھی سوالات یا شبہات تھے
 وہ سب داخلی روشنی کے تجربے میں غرق ہوگئے تھے۔ جب انہوں نے عنایت شاہ کے پاس آنے کا ارادہ کرلیا تھا تو لوگوں نے انہیں یہ کہتے ہوئے منع کردیا تھا کہ،
</b> <b>"آپ بڑے عالم ، معجزاتی طاقتوں کے مالک اور پیغمبر اسلام کے فرزند ہیں۔
</p>

<blockquote>All of Bulleh Shah's compositions are suffused with love and gratitude for his Master.
 In this love he identified his Master with the Lord. He has addressed Shah Inayat with such words as guide, as one who 
 unites people with God, besides calling him spouse, husband, Lord, friend, and beloved.
 To be incessantly weeping in separation of his Master had become the usual routine for Bullah. <br><br>
This separation of his had assumed the proportions of madness, and he started roaming in streets and lanes. 
The intense longing to see his Master produced a kind of fire within him, to extinguish which he began to think out some
 plans. "I He knew that his Master was a lover of music. It is said that Bulleh put on the garb of a woman, got hold of a 
sarangi  and went to the house of a dancing girl. He learnt dancing from her and became an adept in it. He then took along with him a drummer and a harmonium player and went to the tomb of a holy man in whose memory an annual function was being celebrated. Shah Inayat had also come to attend it. While all other dancers and singers got tired and sat down, Bullah, in ecstasy, continued to dance. His voice was extremely doleful and heart-rending. It is .said that Bullah sang many kafis on the occasion. At last even Inayat Shah's heart melted. With a voice full of compassion he said, " Are you Bullah ?" Bullah ran and fell at his Master's feet and replied with his eyes full of tears, <b>"Sir, I am not Bullah put Bhulla. " </b>
<br>
<br>The Master is never indifferent to his disciple. When he realized that the fire of repentance and separation had 
purified Bullah and turned him into pure gold, he forgave him his lapse and pressed him to his heart.
The reason why the Master put Bulleh Shah to such a hard test -the torture of burning in the fire of separation and 
longing ~ was to make him fit to receive the invaluable wealth of the Word of God. With this spiritual treasure he was
 not only to become rich himself, but also to make other seekers the recipients of this wealth
 In real words Bulleh Shah's electric spirit which chafed at the restriction of caste and sect exposed him, during his 
life time, to the reproach of being unorthodox, but the holiness of his life effectively silenced his critics.

<blockquote>Bulleh Shah lived during the same period as of Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. His lifetime also
 extended with the Punjabi poet Waris Shah of Heer Ranjha fame, and the Sindhi Sufi poet Sachal Sarmast.
<br><br>Hazrat Baba Bulleh Shah practiced the Sufism of Punjabi poetry established by poets like Shah Hussain, Sultan Bahu
, and Shah Sharaf. Verses narrated by Bulleh Shah are popularly known as “Kafi”. This kind of poetry is popular in Siraiki and Sindhi poetry.
<br><br>Baba Bulleh Shah’s work represented him as a humanist who wants to give workable solution to the social problems
 of his surroundings. Bulleh Shah’s poetry highlights his mystical spiritual voyage through the four stages of Sufism: 
Shariat, Tariqat, Haqiqat, and Marfat. Bulleh Shah’s poetry is in simple language that has been able to address the complex fundamental issues of life and humanity. Islamic orthodoxy is being criticized by Bulleh Shah’s poetry & philosophy.
<br><br>In modern times, Bulleh Shah’s Kafi is modified to be used to music. Every genre of singer like street- singers,
 to legends like Abida Parveen, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sain Zahoor, and Waddali Brothers, UK based Asian artists, and 
Pakistani rock band Junoon, has sung Bulleh Shah’s Kafi in a beautiful manner.

<h4>Shrine of Hazrat Baba Bulleh Shah</h4>
<h3>When 1171 (Hijiri) had come to pass,<br>
In Qasur his shrine was well raised.</h3>
<blockquote>
Bulleh Shah was an evolved soul, a perfect faqir and a true lover. Through the love for his Master he realized the Lord.
 In his love one finds poignancy, ardor and longing besides sincerity, sacrifice and renunciation. Under the canopy of 
love he made his offerings of caste and learning. His love for his Master never wavered for a moment despite the fire of 
separation and longing through which he passed. His writings, as also his life, manifest transcendence of physical love
 ( of the Master) to divine love ( of the Lord). Indeed, this is. the path of all true mystics, all true lovers of God.
<br><br>
Whosoever has attained union with the Lord has done so by traveling on this path, and whosoever will attain this union, 
will do so by becoming a traveler on this path of love. Bulleh Shah's life and writings are replete with subtle secrets of
 the path. They do riot only strengthen the love of a true lover, but also encourage him to undergo the severest hardships
 for reaching the spiritual goal. The life and compositions of Bulleh Shah will serve as a lighthouse for times immemorial 
to true seekers of spiritual realization.
